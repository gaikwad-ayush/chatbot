ðŸ“„ Project Title:
Terminal-Based Rule-Based ChatBot Using Python

ðŸ“˜ Project Description:
This project is a simple and efficient terminal-based chatbot developed using Python. It is a rule-based system, meaning it relies on a set of predefined inputs and corresponding responses instead of machine learning or external APIs. This makes the chatbot lightweight, easy to understand, and ideal for offline use and educational purposes.

The chatbot runs directly in the command line and interacts with users by responding to their queries with appropriate replies based on keywords. For example, if the user says "hello", the chatbot replies with "Hi there! How can I help you?". The chatbot also understands basic greetings, questions like "how are you", and common phrases like "thanks", "help", or "bye".

The main functionality is achieved using a Python dictionary, where user inputs are matched against keys in the dictionary. If a match is found, the corresponding value is returned as the botâ€™s response. If the input does not match any known phrase, the bot replies with a default message such as "Sorry, I didnâ€™t understand that."

This chatbot does not require any external libraries or internet connection. It only uses standard Python functions like input() and print(), making it an excellent beginner-level project for those learning Python or interested in chatbot logic.

The chatbot continues the conversation in a loop until the user types "bye", at which point the program exits. Its modular structure makes it easy to customize by adding more phrases and responses.
